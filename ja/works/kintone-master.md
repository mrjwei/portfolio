This program automates a major task performed on Kintone and helped my colleague save as many as **7 hours/month**. It is another automation program I developed following [Sheets Master](/works/sheets-master).

## Scope Definition

As another project extending the [Sheets Master](/works/sheets-master), I looked to automate tasks on Kintone, the main operation platform we used.

However, these tasks were different than those performed on Google Sheets in that many of them required case-by-case handling which would take much longer time to automate. My responsibility was to separate these tasks and try to automate the others first.

One of the tasks my interview subjects wanted to get rid of was updating user records. It was particularly time-consuming and repetitive. So I made it my target.

## Planning & Design

The feedback, which I collected from my colleagues who tried my Sheets Master program, showed that people liked the clean and intuitive UI. So this time I did extensive exploration of UI design as well.

My extensive exploration of the logic and UI of Kintone Master.
