It requires macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher.

### Install

Installation is easy and just follow these steps:

- After the download is completed, double-click the downloaded file.
- Drag the Clipy icon into Applications directory and you are ready to go!

## Basic Usage

- If you have not started Clipy, go to *Applications* directory, find Clipy icon and double-click it.
If it is started, its icon should appear in the Menu Bar like this.

Now, let's try Clipy's copy and paste functionality out by taking the following steps.

1. open your browser, go to amazon and copy its URL from URL bar by pressing **cmd + c**.
2. Open a new tab, go to another website, say, youtube and copy its URL from URL bar by pressing **cmd + c**.
3. Open another blank tab, at its URL bar, press **cmd + ctrl + v** and choose the youtube URL from the popup menu. The URL should be correctly pasted.

You see you can access what you copied from the history and not just restricted to the last one as you are with built-in clipboard. This means if you have, for example, multiple lines of code that are scattered in different files and you want copy them into a new file, you don't need to copy one line, paste it into the new file and repeat. Instead, you can just copy all of them at once and paste them into the new file by repeating **cmd + ctrl + v**, which is way more convenient!

## Advanced Usage

### Configuration

Clipy provides rich customization options. I find I use *General*, *Menu* and *Shortcuts* the most. But you are free to take a look at other option groups and try them out.

- General options. These are really the general settings, one of which I made a custom change is the number of history entries.
- Menu options. Here one of the important options is number of entries per folder. As the number of items in each folder affects usability, make sure to test out different numbers and find the one that fits you best.
- Shortcut options. These settings are pretty straightforward. You just set the shortcuts that make you comfortable.

### Add Custom Snippets

One of the truly powerful functionalities of Clipy is custom snippets. These can be pieces of text, code, URL and so on that you save in Clipy. When you need to use them, just access them from the snippet menu and paste them directly to the target.

Add a snippet.
