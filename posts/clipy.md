Clipy is a clipboard extension for MacOS. It supports text and multiple media formats, stores copy history for reuse and is highly customizable. If you want to work more efficiently, then this is a tool that you cannot miss.

## Get Started

### Requirement

It requires macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher.

### Install

Installation is easy and just follow these steps:

- Go to the [official distribution site](https://clipy-app.com/) and click **Download**.
- After the download is completed, double-click the downloaded file.
- Drag the Clipy icon into Applications directory and you are ready to go!

## Basic Usage

### Start and Open Clipy

- If you have not started Clipy, go to Applications directory and find Clipy icon. Then double-click it.
If it is started, its icon should appear in the Menu Bar like this.

- After you started it, try clicking the icon. It should look something like this.

- Then try hovering on the directory icon. Items that you copied recently will appear like this.

## Advanced Usage

When you work with arrow function, you must make sure the code on the right hand of the arrow:

1. is wrapped with **curly brackets** and the `return` keyword is used to return the value. Or:
2. is wrapped with **parentheses** and the `return` keyword **omitted** when you don't perform any other operations except returning a value. Or:
3. is not wrapped with anything, just the value to return. Remember you **MUST** wrap a return value, which has curly brackets itself, with parentheses.

### Best Practice

It's recommended that you **ALWAYS** use `return` keyword where possible. This makes the code more readable and less likely to introduce errors (if not avoid them completely).
