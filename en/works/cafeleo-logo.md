## Concept

I love vetor graphics and at one time, I was obssessed with animal logo designs. This logo was created based on the image of a lion and has a symmetric shape which helps strike a visual balance.

Inspired by organic and delicate medieval designs often seen in European countries like the UK, I carefully chose the color scheme and added some small decorations to the overall modern and simple design, to reflect the characteristics of classic designs.
