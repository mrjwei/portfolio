I started a 30-day-challenges project today to develop a habit of learning & building things every day. This is actually part of my commitment to [100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), a famous habit-changing project. You can read more about my challenges at [30-Day Challenges](https://challenges.jessewei.jp/).
