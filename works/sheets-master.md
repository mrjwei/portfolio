Social welfare facilities normally have huge amounts of documents to manage and it is usually done by hand. This is not just unproductive but is unsustainable in terms of employee health. This was the reason why I developed automation programs to improve the situation.

Sheets Master is a Python program that helped my colleagues save as many as **12 hours/month** that had been spent on working with Google Sheets. It has a simple UI and doing those tasks means just a couple of clicks.

## Problem Identification

The problem was quite obvious from the outset, as I was one of those who experienced it. I just needed to frame it a bit more. So I started by observing my colleagues doing Google Sheets tasks to discover the pain points.

Some of the pain points I noticed were:

- It took significantly longer for documents 3 or more levels down in the Google Drive directory tree to be located.
- All tasks involved repetitive operations such as *locate a file > update it > go back to top level directory > repeat*.
- Two of my 5 observation subjects made at least one mistake in the tasks and one of them did not even notice it.
- One of the most common frustrations was the switch of input sources. Subjects tried to input an English letter when Japanese kanas got input and vice versa.

## Planning & Design

Based on what I found, I decided to **automate two of the Google Sheets tasks that consumed the most time and were most error-prone**. And with the non-programmer users in mind, I spent a lot of time in designing the UI so that the program would be easier to use for all.

My explorations.
