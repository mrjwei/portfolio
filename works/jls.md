## Scope Definition

My client wants a web application that meets the following expectations:

- It displays information about the service, the course and plans in an easy-to-follow manner.

- User can make payments for products, including courses, premium resources, ect.
- The app looks cool and helps increase conversion rate.

## Project Kickoff

The first thing to consider was the tools/technologies to use. Because there would be much navigation involved and performance really matters, I chose Nextjs for the frontend. For the backend, as there are just too many options that do the job, I chose Django becasue I'm most familiar with it.

Long story short, the technology stack I chose was:

- Frontend: Nextjs
- Backend: Django + PostgreSQL + [Stripe](https://stripe.com/jp/payments/checkout)
