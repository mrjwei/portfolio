This is a side project built upon this [MDN React tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started). In the tutorial, I learned a lot about the essentials of React and upon finishing it, I wanted to challenge myself and take this app a step further.

## The branding

In order to turn this challenge into a complete project, I started by designing its branding. The logo is formed by two hands to convey the message of ***handy***. The two hands then shapes an angled letter ***H***, taken from the initial of *handy*.
